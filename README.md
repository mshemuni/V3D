# V3D
V3D is a 3D vector library for basic Vector operations.
It was inspired by: https://github.com/allelos/vectors

## WHY
Why I created this work?
The work done https://github.com/allelos/vectors was good. However some of functions was not there yet (such as from_mag_and_dir).
In the other hand I needed the module with logging ability. So I added it.

## pip

It is not pip installable. However will be soon.

## Example
